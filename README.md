Project Structure:
The project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.
It consists of three main layers: lib, data, domain, and presentation.
Data Layer:
Responsible for data management, including repositories, data sources, and models.
Domain Layer:
Encapsulates the business logic of the application, including use cases and entities.
Presentation Layer:
Handles UI and state management, including view models and Flutter widgets.
Features:
Authentication: User login and registration functionality.
Task Management: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks.
State Management: Implemented using a Flutter state management solution such as Bloc or Cubit.
Test:
The project includes unit tests for both the Bloc and Repository.
Challenges:
Pagination: Handling data pagination, likely for displaying a large number of tasks.
Simulating data in add, update, and delete operations: Presumably, this refers to testing scenarios that involve manipulating task data.
